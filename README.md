## 🆕 Player Enhancement Layer

The enhancement layer enriches player data with real-world context to fix stale projections and prevent common mistakes:

### Key Features

✅ **Bye Week Detection** – Automatically zeros projections and displays "BYE WEEK - DO NOT START" for players on bye, preventing accidental starts

✅ **Recent Performance Stats** – Fetches last 1-3 weeks of actual performance from Sleeper API and displays trends (L3W avg: X.X pts/game)

✅ **Performance Flags** – Intelligent alerts including:
- `BREAKOUT_CANDIDATE` – Recent performance > 150% of projection
- `TRENDING_UP` – Recent performance exceeds projection
- `DECLINING_ROLE` – Recent performance < 70% of projection
- `HIGH_CEILING` – Explosive upside potential
- `CONSISTENT` – Reliable, steady performance

✅ **Adjusted Projections** – Blends recent reality with stale projections for more accurate start/sit decisions (60/40 or 70/30 weighting based on confidence)

### Example

**Before Enhancement:**
```json
{
  "name": "Rico Dowdle",
  "sleeper_projection": 4.0,
  "recommendation": "Bench"
}
```

**After Enhancement:**
```json
{
  "name": "Rico Dowdle",
  "sleeper_projection": 4.0,
  "adjusted_projection": 14.8,
  "performance_flags": ["BREAKOUT_CANDIDATE", "TRENDING_UP"],
  "enhancement_context": "Recent breakout: averaging 18.5 pts over last 3 weeks",
  "recommendation": "Strong Start"
}
```

The enhancement layer is **non-breaking** and automatically applies to:
- `ff_get_roster` (with `include_external_data=True`)
- `ff_get_waiver_wire` (with `include_external_data=True`)
- `ff_get_players` (with `include_external_data=True`)

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Strategy Weights (Balanced Default)
```python
{
    "yahoo": 0.40,     # Yahoo expert projections
    "sleeper": 0.40,   # Sleeper expert rankings
    "matchup": 0.10,   # Defensive matchup analysis
    "trending": 0.05,  # Player trending data
    "momentum": 0.05   # Recent performance
}
```

### Draft Strategies
- **Conservative**: Prioritize proven players, minimize risk
- **Aggressive**: Target high-upside breakout candidates
- **Balanced**: Optimal mix of safety and ceiling potential

### Position Scoring Baselines
- RB: ~11 points (standard scoring)
- WR: ~10 points (standard scoring)
- TE: ~7 points (standard scoring)
- FLEX calculations include position scarcity adjustments

## 📊 Performance Metrics

The optimization engine targets:
- **85%+** accuracy on start/sit decisions
- **+2.0** points per optimal decision on average
- **90%+** lineup efficiency vs. manual selection
- **Position-normalized FLEX** decisions to avoid TE traps

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Errors**
```bash
# Refresh expired tokens (expire hourly)
python utils/refresh_token.py

# Full re-authentication if refresh fails
python reauth_yahoo.py
```

**Only One League Showing**
- Verify `YAHOO_GUID` matches your Yahoo account
- Ensure leagues are active for current season
- Check team ownership detection in logs

**Rate Limiting**
- Yahoo allows 1000 requests/hour
- Server implements 900/hour safety limit
- Use `ff_get_api_status` to monitor usage
- Clear cache with `ff_clear_cache` if needed

**Stale Data**
- Cache TTLs: Leagues (1hr), Standings (5min), Players (15min)
- Force refresh with `ff_clear_cache` tool
- Check last update times in `ff_get_api_status`
